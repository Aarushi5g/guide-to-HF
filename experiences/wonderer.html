        I am a Korean programmer. I wanted to contribute to the open source, but I couldn't try it because I was afraid of English. 
        <br>
        <br>
        However, I recently found out about the event called hacktoberfest, so I'm trying it out with courage. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope other people who are not familiar with English like me can participate with courage.
