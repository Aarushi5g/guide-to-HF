                <p class="lead"> i) Hi, I am Amit Kumar Mitra. I have done my B.Tech in CSE this year. I am currently working at Persistent Systems Limited and Then I came to know
                about this Hackoctober Fest. So I decided to take part in this</p>

                <p class="lead">ii) Here I got some experience about open source project. Also some guide from some youtube videos that how to start.
                Then I started to contribute in some of the projects and that really feels awesome.</p>
                
                <p class="lead">iii) Also I am still learning the advance parts  of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to gain further knowledge and 
                reflect it in other projects.</p>

                <p class="lead">iv) I have some pull request's in different repo's and also sharing my thoughts here. Though some of my pr's were not 
                accepted due to certain reasons. So, I am trying different ways. So that's my experience here. 
                <br> <br>Thank You
                </p>
