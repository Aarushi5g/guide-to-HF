    <h1>My Experience - Hacktober Fest 2020</h1>
    <p>Hacktober Fest is an amazing initiative started for generating more contributors to the open source community, and luckily this year I got to know about this oppertunity an I became more acquainted with the Hacktober fest. Notwithstanding, I had no earlier information about how the Pull Request part truly functioned. I had no clue about commits and even how to run git and github.<br> 
However, in the end I got everything after a couple of attempts, since I concluded that I needed to do it. So I went through hours looking around Google, watching various types of videos on Open Source Community on Youtube and trust me, after sometime I realized that we can easily be a part of it. So have confidence in yourself and take care of the Repositeries!!!</p>
