            This is my first time at Hacktoberfest and I am excited like never before. After getting to know the 
            idea of Hacktoberfest, I registered and started searching some repos I might be able to contribute to.
            I found a repo that was meant to define 'classes' in every programming language available. 
            I tried my shot at it and it got merged! I got motivated to carry on further with the challenge.
            To y'all out there, there is something in Open Source for everyone, don't be afraid to take a leap of faith!
