                <li>Started using git more often and made my first pull request.</li>
                <li>I've come to appreciate the importance of open source code. I see how it brings people together and creates communities.</li>
                <li>Open source can definitely be daunting for newbies like me, but I think everyone might have something to contribute to a project in unexpected ways. It can still be complicated at times, but it isn't something that cannot be learned. </li>
                <li>I'd recommend everyone to somehow be involved in open source. Even if it isn't something major.</li>
