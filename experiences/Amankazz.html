    <p class="title ">Actually during my first year, I was not aware about this fest cause no one told me about this amazing fest. But during my second year, an open source community in our college had conducted a event hacknight-2020 that is where i got the brief idea about this amazing fest.</p>
    <p class="title">I think hacktober fest is a greate initiative to bring young programmers and developers to open source. </p>
    <p class="title ">This is my first time in hacktober fest and i'm quiet liking the atmosphere.</p>
