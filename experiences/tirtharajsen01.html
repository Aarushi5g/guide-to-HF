    <h1>
        My First HacktoberFest Experience
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p id="paraone">
            This is my first hacktober fest contest.This is eventually my first open source contribution.
            I was pretty confused as I didn't have any knowledge of git and github ,how to clone ,fork and pull
            requests.
            I also didn't know how to choose between projects. So I randomly traversed on the github Website for the
            projects where I found this
            beautiful project to contribute.What atrracted me was that this was a beginner friendly project where one
            can brush up the pre-requisites
            of an open source contribution.
        </p>

            I also feel that this contribution will also give me a learning in the HTML and CSS concepts.They will give
            me an edge at the time of an open source contribution in web Dev,as these features are very essential in
            making web Dev applications.SO i feel that I will be left with a good amount of knowledge after paricipating
            in hacktober fest.
        </p>
        <p id="parathree">
            Finally I feel that my first ever pull in github will be accepted and this will also encourage me in
            contributing more and more on open sources platforms.Wish I could complete my hactober fest's all 4 pulls.
        </p>

            contributino platforms :D
