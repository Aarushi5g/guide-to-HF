<h3 class =" hover-black"><u>My First Hacktober Fest</u></h3>

   <p class = "hover-white">
    Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests on GitHub.

    <p class = "hover-white"> <b>Hii, I'm Sagar Ramlani.</b><br>
    This is my second pull request and I'm so thrilled. 
    <br>
    It was difficult for me in starting and I was afraid that how can I change the code of other person who is much more experienced than me but later I found out that all the developers on open source are very supportive and they want us to be confident about our code and make a better community by helping others.
