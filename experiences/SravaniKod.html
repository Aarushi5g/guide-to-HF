            <p class="p">   This is my first time participating in Hacktoberfest.To get familiar, I am getting 
                started with beginner-friendly repos.I came to know about this event on social media and was
                very excited to take a deep dive into this Digital Ocean's hacktoberfest. I have enrolled in some of the
                meetups which were quite informative and interactive this is where I learnt a lot on how to contibute for 
                open source projects.

                If you are a beginner and the terms like open source, hacktoberfest, pull requests are new to you,
                then enrolling for the meetups is a better way to know how the stuff works.There are many good first 
                issue repos that help you make your first PR.
