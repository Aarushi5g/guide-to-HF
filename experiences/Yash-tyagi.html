    <h1><u>My experience to Hactoberfest !!</u></h1> 
    <div class="card">
    <p> I am B.tech cse student. I first heard the name "Hacktoberfest" in my second year from one of my seniors and he told to me participate and
        contribute to open source to grab a cool swag(T-shirt) from Digital Ocean .<br> Then i went to github  but then it is
        very difficult for me to contribute to open source and i ended up doing not even a single pull request (may be due to lack of guidance) . 
        <br>Then I started searching about how
        to use git and github and how to actually write a code which is useful for any community or individual beacuse ultimately our task is to 
        make sure that the changes should be added to the repository.<br>
        Now this year 2020 I am highly dedicated to earn a shirt with "Hacktoberfest 2020" written on it . So i started searching for simple issues in various
        repositories and try to solve them . I know at first it sounds very difficult, to write something which is actually benificial for the 
        community but slowwly as the time passes one gets comfortable in writing clean and optimised code. I am very exited to contribute 
        .Hoping more contributions in near future.
