    <h1>My First HacktoberFest</h1>
    <p>
       It was an amazing experience. I got to learn about how to
      create a pull requests, how to contribute to open source community.
    </p>
     <h1>Motivation for beginners:</h1>
     <p> I am B.tech cse student. I first heard the name "Hacktoberfest" in my second year from one of my seniors and he told to me participate and
        contribute to open source to grab a cool swag(T-shirt) from Digital Ocean .<br> Then i went to github  but then it is
        very difficult for me to contribute to open source and i ended up doing not even a single pull request
        <br>Then I searching about how
        to use git and github and how to actually write a code which is useful for any community or individual beacuse ultimately our task is to 
        make sure that the changes should be added to the repository.So i thank you for 
        giving this opportunity to me to make a pull request.
