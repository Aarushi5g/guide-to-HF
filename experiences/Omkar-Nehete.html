<h1>Hacktoberfest is back. Get Hacking!!</h1>
<p>This is my first Hacktoberfest and I am really excited for it. Learnt a lot till now about the open source culture and how to contribute to it via github
</p>

<p> This is an excellent time to learn about github and contribute to the projects. I learnt creating pull requests in matter of few minutes. Also free swags and goddies are waiting for you at the end. So grab them up.
</p>
<p>For all the newbies, I suggest you to explore github for various projects and make small commits as this may be your first time. All the very best to you all!!</p>
