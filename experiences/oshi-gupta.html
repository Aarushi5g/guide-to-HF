    I am a newbie to open source contribution and recently I had come to know about this open source program HacktoberFest
    and by partcipating in this program I am learning various new things and to know more about git and its commands.

    <h2>BeginnersMotivation :</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I came to know about this program late so first I had visited and learnt about what is open source and how to contribute in it.
     So I had visited various git & github tutorials and how to use it and had some hands on of it.Then I had researched about hactoberfest 
     and understand how it works and read its rules carefully and follow that and started contributing to the repositories.

    <h2>Tips for beginners :</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
    Search for tags like "Good first issue" generally these are very easy to start with.
    You only have to create PR that need not to be labeled as "hacktoberfest". If you feel you can resolve an issue which is not labeled as "hacktoberfest", you can do it and it will be counted as a valid PR!
