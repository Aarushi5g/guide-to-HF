            Besides development, I am interested in various creative activities.
            I love the media full of interaction and stories, and I plan to make it in the future.

        <h2>My experience</h2>
        <p>
            Last month, I learned about Hacktoberfest for the first time.
            But I didn't have any experience in contributing to open source, so I was hesitant to participate.
            About 5 days ago, I participated in the hands-on event of the Hacktoberfest Seoul Conference and experienced two
            open-source pull requests for the first time.
            This was a very new experience for me and made me want to contribute to open source.
            Next year, I want to be a developer who can contribute professionally to open source and have a more rewarding experience at the Hacktoberfest.
            Let's meet again next year!
