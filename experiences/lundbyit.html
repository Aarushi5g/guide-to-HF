                    <p>
                        This year I decided that I would participate in
                        hacktoberfest just for fun. I've been thinking about
                        contributing to open source but had no idea where to start
                        and thought that hacktoberfest maybe would help me get
                        started.

                    <p>My biggest challenge was to find projects and issues I could contribute to. Hacktoberfest is very popular so a lot of issues where taken very quickly.</p>

                        I started research on how to contribute to open source
                        already in the end of september. During that time I read and
                        watched everything on digital oceans resource
                        <a
                            class="link"
                            href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details"
                            >page</a
                        >
                        about hacktoberfest 2020. Most major repositories have a
                        contribution guide. It is either a website or a markdown
                        document named CONTRIBUTING.MD. For example,
                        <a
                            href="https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html"
                            class="link"
                            >React.js</a
                        >
                        or this project
                        <a
                            href="https://github.com/emmalearnscode/guide-to-HF/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"
                            class="link"
                            >Guide-to-HF</a
                        >
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I felt a bit overwhelmed. But got good help by these
                        resources:
                        <br />
                        <strong>OpenSourceTogether</strong>
                        <br />
                        This project was very beginner friendly and it was where I
                        did my first contribution. After that I realised that it
                        wasn't that hard to do a PR.

                            href="https://github.com/OpenSourceTogether/Hacktoberfest-2020"
                            class="link"
                            >Link to repository</a
                        >
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Another good resource is a video series on egghead by
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds" class="link"
                            >Kent C. Dodds</a
                        >
                        . Where he showed how github works.

                    <p>
                        October the 1st. Finally! I was pumped, I was ready and I
                        was really looking forward to contributing to some projects.
                        But I found it really hard to find issues that I could take.
                        Most of the issues were taken very quickly. In hindsight I
                        should have looked up issues that I could have contributed
                        to earlier. I had no idea hacktoberfest was so popular.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Anyhow, after hours and hours of looking for issues that I
                        felt I could help out with. I found a few issues, forked the
                        projects and created some PR:s.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was excited to see if they were going to be approved. But
                        it took a few days and in the end they got approved. I felt
                        very proud and happy to have made "real" contributions to
                        some projects.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>
                    I learnt a lot during hacktoberfest 2020:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to contribute to open source</li>
                        <li>
                            How to get the projects to build on my local computer
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I got a little better understanding of some projects
                            that I did contribute to and projects I did not
                            contribute to
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    I have now found one or two projects that I feel that I would like to contribute to regularly when I have the time.

                    The resources at the top helped me the most during hacktober. I hope they will help you to.
