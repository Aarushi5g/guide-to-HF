<h1>Hacktoberfest is here!</h1>
<p>
I have heard about Hacktoberfest in 2019 already, but this is the first time when I'm confident enough to participate in it myself. I've really started to love the open source projects and how friendly all the contributors here are.
</p>

<p>
I learned a lot about how Git and GitHub work, as previously it seemed like dark magic to me. I also found myself looking into the basics of Python 3, C, and C++ - Hacktoberfest was a great opportunity to start out with these.
</p>

<p>
I think the hard part was to simply gather enough courage to do this. At first I had a lot of fear for getting my pull requests rejected or doing something wrong, but it's not as bad once you get into it. Getting your first accepted pull request feels amazing!
