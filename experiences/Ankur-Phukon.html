      <h1>My Experience with First Open Source Contribution</h1>
    <br>
    <strong>About me</strong>
      <p>
          I am a ReactJs developer living in India. In this article, I am sharing my first open source contribution.
      </p>
      <h4>
          This year(2020) in Oct, I got to know about Open source societies in Github. I looked for some projects which are working with my knowledgeable area. I found some repositories which are working with ReactJS. After reading the Contribution Doc(Which is provided on the repo),
          I got interested in adding some new fatures with ReactJs. 
          First I forked and cloned the repository to my account and local machine.
          Then I created a new branch and stated coding. 
          I developed some information showing related pages where react components are get updated from a Mongo database.
          After commiting and pushing all that stuff, I pulled a request to the owner of the repo and after some days, my commits were accepted.
          That's all. 
          Open Source Projects are really good to get an Experience with Real-World Projects. Try it now.
          <br>

          HAPPY READING!
