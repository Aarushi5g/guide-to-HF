                <p id="paragraph-one">2020 has been the first time I have participated in Hacktoberfest, and you could say I'm a totally new contributor to open source now.</p>
                <p id="paragraph-two">I wasn't planning on participating at first, but I was reminded at a meetup partway through October that #Hacktoberfest was happening. There was still time, so I figured I would try to complete my 4 pull requests this year.</p>

                <br/>This post will be my very first PR in a worldwide open source online event and honestly in my entire life. <br/>
                I do find it aspiring to find a community of people working together to become better programmers.<br/> <br/> 
                 <br/>
              I hope will be a baby step for me to be more involve in any Tech community events.
