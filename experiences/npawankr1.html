    <h1>My First Experience with HacktoberFest</h1>
    <p>
      As this is my first pull request I am so much excited. I am trying my best with it. I made my first contribution to
      this repository. It was an amazing experience. I got to learn about how to
      create a pull requests, how to contribute to open source community, and actually a real time experience to what I learned in HTML AND CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially the feeling of having my own code to an app that many people
      will use is just amazing! And I am very much excited.
    </p>
    <h1>Motivation for beginners:</h1>
    <p>
      When I told most of my friends to take part in it. They told I know no
      programming how will I be able to do? The cool part is you need not to be
      a great coder to take part in hacktoberfest! This is an event which
      focusses on improving your ability to contribute to open source and if
      you're very new... It will help you to learn open source contribution
      which is a very very important part... No it might not be the case that
      you will contribute to some open source organisations (which you should!)
      but it will help you to work in teams and collaborate on projects!
    </p>
    <h1>Tips for beginners:</h1>
    <p>
        Search for tags like "Good first issue" generally these are very easy to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
        You only have to create PR that need not to be labeled as "hacktoberfest". If you feel you can resolve an issue which is <strong>NOT</strong> labeled as "hacktoberfest", you can do it and it will be counted as a valid PR!
